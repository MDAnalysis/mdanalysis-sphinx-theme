==================================
MDAnalysis Sphinx theme Quickstart
==================================

This theme provides a responsive theme for Sphinx documentation by the Open Force Field Initiative.
It is inspired by `Material for Sphinx <https://bashtage.github.io/sphinx-material/>`_ and `Material for MkDocs <https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/>`_, but has been rewritten with the `Bulma <https://bulma.io>`_ CSS framework to remove any JavaScript dependencies.
